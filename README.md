## Plugin development

Read Hardhat's [Plugin Development Guide](https://hardhat.org/advanced/building-plugins.html)

## Testing

(From Hardhat) Running `yarn run test` will run every test located in the `test/` folder. They
use [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/),
but you can customize them.

We recommend creating unit tests for your own modules, and integration tests for
the interaction of the plugin with Hardhat and its dependencies.
